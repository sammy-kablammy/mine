This project is how I learned javascript and html. All graphics were implemented manually through the html canvas.
I came up with a neat recursive approach for finding nearby squares with a value of zero that is used whenever the player clicks on a zero-value square. It works with a mouse by left/right clicking, or it works on touchscreens by tapping/tapping then holding.
